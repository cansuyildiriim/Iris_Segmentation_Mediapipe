# IRS-Segmentation Mediapipe Python
:point_right:IRS-Segmentation is a Python project developed with the Mediapipe framework, aimed at facilitating the real-time segmentation of an object from a video stream. The project provides a set of customizable tools that allow users to fine-tune the segmentation process and adapt it to their specific needs. This is achieved by leveraging the modular architecture of the Mediapipe framework, which enables the combination and customization of different pre-built components.

The project consists of two main parts: a pre-processing pipeline and a segmentation pipeline. The pre-processing pipeline is responsible for preparing the input video stream for segmentation by applying a set of filters and transformations to enhance the quality of the video and optimize the performance of the segmentation process. The segmentation pipeline is responsible for the actual segmentation of the object from the video stream using a pre-trained model that is fine-tuned according to the user's specific needs.

IRS-Segmentation is highly flexible and customizable, and can be adapted to a wide range of use cases, including video conferencing, virtual reality, and gaming. The project is open-source and is available on GitHub for developers who want to use, modify, or contribute to the project. The code is well-documented, and the project provides detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application.
